# Updates

## 0.2.1
- **Build System Optimization**: Switched from Terser to Esbuild minification, resulting in 10x faster build times.
- **I18n Optimization**: Translation compilation is now on-demand (`npm run build:with-i18n`) rather than running on every build.

## 0.2.0
- Renamed "Replicate" command to "Just-Sync now!".
- Fixed initialization crash.
- Default settings optimized for Just Sync.
