# User Preferences

## Interaction Style
- **Direct**: Prefer code actions over explanations.
- **Verification**: User expects you to verify your work (Build -> Deploy -> Report).
- **Security**: The user is security-conscious.
  - No storing tokens in code.
  - No auto-executing terminals without explicit triggers (buttons).

## Specific Environment Variables
- **Target Plugin Folder**: `E:\FATUR\master\.obsidian\plugins\just-sync`
- **Tunnel Name**: Often tests with `obsidian` or `test`, but allows configuration.

## Workflow Quirks
- **TDD Integration**: User knows TDD. When adding a "Server Connection" feature, write the test first.
- **Manual Reloads**: User usually has to manually reload Obsidian to see changes (Ctrl+R). Remind them when necessary.
