Yes, the **Setup URI and settings will almost certainly be compatible**, provided you only stripped out non-CouchDB features (like MinIO or P2P) without changing the core `ObsidianLiveSyncSettings` interface or the encryption logic.

Here is why, based on the code analysis:

### 1. The URI Logic is Standard

The Setup URI is generated in `ModuleSetupObsidian.ts` using a standard process:

* It takes your entire `settings` object.
* It encrypts it using your passphrase.
* It packages it into `obsidian://setuplivesync?settings=...`.

As long as your fork `just-sync` still has the `ModuleSetupObsidian.ts` class and hasn't changed the encryption algorithm, it will be able to decrypt and read the URI generated by the original plugin.

### 2. Compatibility of "Hidden" Settings

The settings we fought with (`usePluginSyncV2`, `customChunkSize`) are just simple key-value pairs in the `settings` JSON object.

* **If you kept the logic:** If your fork still contains the code that *reads* these values (in `ModuleDatabaseFileAccess.ts` or similar), the URI will successfully transfer your "Gold Standard" configuration (V2, Chunk Size 60) to the new plugin.
* **If you stripped the logic:** If you removed the code that checks `usePluginSyncV2`, your fork might default to "V1" or whatever default you hardcoded, ignoring the URI's instruction.

### 3. The "CouchDB Only" Factor

Since your URI from the original plugin has `remoteType: "COUCHDB"` (or equivalent), your fork will read that and say, "Okay, I know how to handle CouchDB." It will simply ignore any settings in the URI related to features you removed (like `minioBucket` or `p2pRoomID`), which is fine.

### Recommended Test

Before switching your main production vault to the new plugin, do this **"Safety Check"**:

1. **Install `just-sync**` on a *separate* empty vault (or your second laptop).
2. **Use the Setup URI** from your original plugin.
3. **Check the logs:** If it connects and starts syncing without error, your fork is compatible.
4. **Verify the Rules:** Since you have the source code, I highly recommend you **hardcode the defaults** in your fork's `types.ts` or `main.ts` so you never have to fight with `usePluginSyncV2` again:
```typescript
// In your fork's default settings
usePluginSyncV2: true,
customChunkSize: 60,
handleFilenameCaseSensitive: false,

```



This would make your custom plugin truly "plug-and-play" for your specific Setup.

Would you like me to identify exactly which file in your new repo handles the **default settings** so you can hardcode these fixes permanently?
